cckala is Created by Mohammad Bazazzadeh for the basic Programming final project on 2/3/2024 and it is a simple example of an online store written in the c language.

We have two types of users seller and buyer. Sellers can provide a product and should give all the details needed in the program for their products and gain credit after somebody buys their product, buyers can add credit for themselves and buy products provided by the sellers and can rate the products and also leave comments for a specified product. 

All the user and product data are saved in two folders one for users and one for products and they both are in consonant with each other in the program.
